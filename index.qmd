Hi, I'm Adena! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in [Biological Sciences](https://www.bisi.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland, where I am exploring environmental microbial evolution in my lab rotations. I am using bioinformatics and microscopy to investigate the exciting questions about co-evolution in the microbial world.

My previous research in [Prof. Laura Katz's Lab](https://www.science.smith.edu/katzlab/) at Smith College and in [Prof. Nina Lin's Lab](https://lin.engin.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan drove my curiosity for evolution and microbiology.

I also recently assessed data accessibility in microbiology manuscripts as a bioinformatician in [Prof. Pat Schloss's Lab](https://www.schlosslab.org/) at Michigan Medicine. While there, I started volunteering as a certified [Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) Instructor. I currently instruct workshops with the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries chapter.

Outside the lab, you can find me playing kickball, rugby, or reading zines.
