Hi, I'm Adena! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in [Biological Sciences](https://www.bisi.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland. I use bioinformatics and microscopy to investigate the exciting questions about co-evolution in the microbial world.

My previous research focused on microbial eukaryotic biodiversity and genome evolution in [Prof. Laura Katz's Lab](https://www.science.smith.edu/katzlab/) and strain engineering in [Prof. Nina Lin's Lab](https://lin.engin.umich.edu/). I also assessed data accessibility in microbiology manuscripts as a bioinformatician in [Prof. Pat Schloss's Lab](https://www.schlosslab.org/). 

While there, I started volunteering as a certified [Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) Instructor. I currently instruct workshops with the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries chapter.

I am currently rotating in [Prof. Mihai Pop's Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/cs.umd.edu/poplab/). 

Outside the lab, you can find me playing kickball, rugby, or reading zines.
