Hi, I'm Adena! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in [Biological Sciences](https://www.bisi.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland, where I'm exploring environmental microbial evolution. I enjoy using bioinformatics and microscopy to investigate the exciting questions of the microbial world.

My previous work in the [Katz Lab](https://www.science.smith.edu/katzlab/) at Smith College and the [Lin Lab](https://lin.engin.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan drove my curiosity for evolution and microbiology.

Most recently, I explored data accessibility in microbiology manuscripts in the [Schloss Lab](https://www.schlosslab.org/) at Michigan Medicine. At Michigan, I became a certified [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) Instructor, and I'm continuing instructing with the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries chapter.

Outside the lab, you can find me playing rugby or reading graphic novels and zines.
