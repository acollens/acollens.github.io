I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Biological Sciences at University of Maryland. I use bioinformatics and microscopy to investigate the exciting questions about co-evolution in the microbial world.\nMy previous research focused on microbial eukaryotic biodiversity and genome evolution in Prof. Laura Katz’s Lab and strain engineering in Prof. Nina Lin’s Lab. I also assessed data accessibility in microbiology manuscripts as a bioinformatician in Prof. Pat Schloss’s Lab.\nWhile there, I started volunteering as a certified Software Carpentries Instructor. I currently instruct workshops with the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries chapter.\nI am currently rotating in Prof. Mihai Pop’s Lab.\nOutside the lab, you can find me playing kickball, rugby, or reading zines."
