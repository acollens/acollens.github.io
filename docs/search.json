I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Biological Sciences at University of Maryland co-advised by Prof. Mihai Pop and Prof. Allen Collins. I use metagenomic assembly methods to investigate exciting questions about co-evolution between microbes and their hosts.\nMy previous research focused on microbial eukaryotic biodiversity and genome evolution in Prof. Laura Katz’s Lab and strain engineering in Prof. Nina Lin’s Lab. I also assessed data accessibility in microbiology manuscripts as a bioinformatician in Prof. Pat Schloss’s Lab.\nWhile there, I started volunteering as a certified Software Carpentries Instructor. I currently instruct workshops with the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries chapter.\nOutside the lab, you can find me playing kickball, rugby, or reading zines."

    "text": "A Novel Plasmid Reconstruction and Identification Pipeline for Salmonella Outbreak Tracking\nCollaboration with Nathalie A. I. Bonin, Seth Commichaux, and Mihai Pop\n\nFood-borne illnesses cause 128K hospitalizations and $15.5B in economic impact annually. Because of this, the Food and Drug Administration curates genomes of the most common pathogens in the NCBI Pathogen Detection database (NCBI-PD), currently totaling 1.8M isolates. These data are the basis of over 1,220 published research studies and applications to-date on detection and treatment of food-borne illness.\nA recent pilot study on a Salmonella outbreak revealed the critical role of plasmids (mobile DNA isolated from the main chromosome) in epidemiological tracking. Despite this, plasmids remain under-used in pathogen identification and tracing because NCBI-PD genomes are assembled through a method which ineffectively captures plasmid sequences. Moreover, prevailing plasmid assembly tools have yet to be benchmarked for large, high-throughput datasets or are unable to distinguish between chromosomal and plasmid sequences.\nOur project aims to re-analyze a randomly-chosen subset of raw sequences from the NCBI-PD genomes to include pathogen-associated plasmids. First, we are benchmarking existing plasmid reconstruction methods. Next we are incorporating scalable and reproducible methods for sequence assembly, sorting, and clustering into current plasmid reconstruction methods and databases. Our workflow will annotate and validate the plasmids we assembled before re-linking them to their NCBI-PD bacterial isolates resulting in an improved and robust data set. Upon reaching significant improvements with this preliminary subset, we plan to expand our analysis to the entire database."
