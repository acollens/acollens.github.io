I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Biological Sciences at University of Maryland, where I’m exploring environmental microbial evolution. I enjoy using bioinformatics and microscopy to investigate the exciting questions of the microbial world.\nMy previous work in the Katz Lab at Smith College and the Lin Lab at University of Michigan drove my curiosity for evolution and microbiology.\nMost recently, I explored data accessibility in microbiology manuscripts in the Schloss Lab at Michigan Medicine. At Michigan, I became a certified Carpentries Instructor, and I’m continuing instructing with the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries chapter.\nOutside the lab, you can find me playing rugby or reading graphic novels and zines."
