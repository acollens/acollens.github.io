## World Ocean Day

###### June 7th, 2024

I had a great time introducing Natural History museum visitors to *Convolutriloba* and their internal garden of *Tetraselmis* algae. We used dinoscopes (small handheld light microscopes) to take a look at the worms swimming and laying flat in the dish to let their algae absorb the light from a flashlight. (Photos by Phillip R.

## Rutgers Data Carpentries Genomics Workshop

###### April 25-26th 2024

I had an amazing time teaching the Genomics Carpentries workshop to biologists at Rutgers looking to expand their bioinformatics skills. It was my first non-home institution workshop and it went very well, Janet Adler and the iJOBs program were great hosts I was glad to be invited to teach alongside Aziz Khan, with helpers Khang Dang & Sam Desind.
